              Searching recipes by ingredients is a powerful tool that
              transforms the way you plan your meals. Instead of starting with a
              recipe, why not begin with the ingredients you already have? This
              feature allows users to input the ingredients they have on hand or
              wish to use, and it returns a selection of recipes that utilize
              those ingredients. Whether you're looking to minimize waste, use
              up leftovers, or simply want to experiment with what you have,
              searching by ingredients ensures that you can create delicious and
              nutritious meals without having to shop for additional items.

                Bite SA is a labor of love born from a simple yet universal
                dilemma—what to cook with the ingredients already in your
                fridge? On a particular evening, amidst the struggle of deciding
                what to prepare for my family, the idea for Bite SA sparked. The
